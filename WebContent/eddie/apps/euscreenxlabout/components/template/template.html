	            				The EUscreen portal offers free  access to thousands of items of archive moving image material. It brings together clips that provide an insight into the social, cultural, political and economic events that have shaped the 20th and 21st centuries. As well as chronicling important historical events, the EUscreen portal allows you to explore television programmes that focus on everyday experience. EUscreen is also intended to be a resource for educators, researchers and media professionals and allow them access to audiovisual content from across Europe.
	            			</p>
	            			<p>
	            				The EUscreen portal was built by a consortium of European audiovisual archives, academic and technical partners. It has ben supported through two projects funded by the European Commission. The EUscreen project ran from 2009 - 2012 and its successor, EUscreenXL, began in 2013 and runs until 2016 under the CIP ICT-PSP support programme. 
	            			</p>
	            			<p>
	            			The main objective of the project is to aggregate a comprehensive amount of professional audiovisual content. A large number of clips and programmes have been selected by the broadcasters and archives from all across Europe and included in a number of specially devised virtual exhibitions, curated topical collections and collections of popular clips. The project  aims to engage users with digital heritage content and facilitate the use of videos, photos, audio and images through the MyEUscreen platform.
